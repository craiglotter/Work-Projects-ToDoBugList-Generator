Work Projects ToDoBugList Generator is a simple application that runs through all the Work Project folders in a specified base folder, adding all the missing To Do List and Bug List text files should they not be already present in that particular work project folder.

To select the Projects folder to check, either click on the browse button or drag and drop the folder straight on to the text box. Note that a Projects base folder follows the form of "Base Project Folder" -> "Example App - 04 November 2004" -> "Source Code" -> "Example App - 04 November 2004" -> "Required Files"

To start the operation, simply click on the Begin button. 

The help and about menu options brings up the help and about dialog boxes respectively. The AutoUpdate menu option forces the application to run an autoupdate.
